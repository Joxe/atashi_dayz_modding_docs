# Introduction
Scripting in DayZ is a rabbit hole and a half, it's very hard to make documentation that covers it all. I don't want this to be some sort of API with a explanation to each function, partly because I don't know them all myself and partly because I feel like sharing cool tips and tricks might be more valuable to people that aren't used to scripting. The [Bohemia Wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Enforce_Script_Syntax) has a rather extensive explanation of all the core concepts of Enscript which is very useful if you are coming from a programmer background. If you are a C/C++ programmer you won't have any issues grasping Enscript, C#/Java programmers probably won't either as soon as they get `autoptr` and `ref` keywords, it might be a bit more work for higher level than that. This directory will try to contain files for each "concept" and also a directory if they require more than one file to explain.
