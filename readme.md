# Introduction
Since we live in the year 20XX it seems like all knowledge about DayZ modding is located inside Discord servers. While Discord is really nice as a place to talk about things it's really not that good for documentation and finding out how to something as a third-party. Its search function is really lacking and people generally come to Discord to talk about things that doesn't work which gives a lot of false positives when you search for something. I want this repository to work as some sort of dumping grounds for what I have personally learned from modding DayZ by showing off guides and working code with (hopefully) proper documentation to complement it.

That said, there is a lot that I don't know. Many things in my mod ([ZeroRevival](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3248612546) #ad) have ended up as "oh, I guess this works" and is very likely not the best solution, so if you see something that's blatantly wrong I would very much appreciate if it would be raised as an issue or pull request to rectify the issue, I'm eager to learn. If I write something that I am unsure about I will try to make sure that it's painfully obvious that it is. If I get corrected the credit for the correction will also be added somewhere on the related page.
